Instructions for Building EDuke32's Library Dependencies Targeting ARM64
========================================================================

First, follow these instructions: http://wiki.eduke32.com/wiki/Building_EDuke32_on_Windows

Dependencies
------------
Install vcpkg from https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg. Using MinGW is currently problematic with ARM64, so vcpkg is the best option. For convenience, add the vcpkg directory to your PATH.

Build the dependencies: vcpkg install libflac:arm64-windows-static libvpx:arm64-windows-static sdl2:arm64-windows-static

Next, you must copy the built libraries from [vcpkg]\installed\arm64-windows-static\lib into platform\Windows\lib\ARM64, and rename them as follows:
FLAC.lib -> libFLAC.a
SDL2.lib -> libSDL2.a
manual-link\SDL2main.lib -> libSDL2main.a
vpxmt.lib -> libvpx.a

dsound, dxguid, and dxguid_sdl
-------------------------------------------------

These files will be compiled with https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw. Download and extract it in an MSYS2 environment, and add llvm-mingw/bin to your MSYS PATH.

Once you have everything set up, proceed as follows:

cd eduke32/platform/Windows/src/dxlibs
make PREFIX=aarch64-w64-mingw32
cp *.a ../../lib/ARM64
